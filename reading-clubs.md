### Planning timeline of the next reading club

- Polls to determine the topic and date of the next reading club become available on our [ReadtheLOD chat channel](https://chat.semantic.works/#/room/#readthelod:chat.semantic.works) around the 15th of the month. These will remain open for 2 weeks.
- The date is aimed to be set somewhere between 4-6 weeks following these polls.
- And reading club notes are aimed to become available in the 2 weeks following the reading club.
