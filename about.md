#### Who

Read the LOD is a grassroots LOD initiative that organizes reading-and-discussion clubs around relevant contemporary Linked Data and Semantic Web documents.

#### What

The reading club is a monthly event where we read and discuss a document together. The document can be a scientific paper, a blog post, a book chapter, a tutorial, a specification, a use case, a strategy, a component, etc. The document is chosen by the community through a poll. The reading club is organized by the community, and the discussion is led by a moderator.

#### Why

- to read everything you always wanted but never took up time for,
- to be able to ask those questions that have been bothering you,
- to share ideas, strategies, motivational spins, use cases and components,
- and to keep building the community.

#### Where and when

Check out our [ReadtheLOD chat channel](https://chat.semantic.works/#/room/#readthelod:chat.semantic.works) to find out more about the next reading club!
